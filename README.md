An app that downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app will allow users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.

With this app I learned about the following subjects:

Persist arrays and dictionaries to the Documents directory, and persist custom structs using a Keyed Archiver.

How Core Data manages its stack.

How to create a Core Data stack from the ground up.

How to specify relationships between you your Core Data managed objects.

How Core Data relates to MVC design as Apple envisioned it. 

How to architect apps so that controller objects are notified whenever the data stored in Core Data changes, allowing the controllers to keep the views updated in ways that keep your code trim and extensible.
